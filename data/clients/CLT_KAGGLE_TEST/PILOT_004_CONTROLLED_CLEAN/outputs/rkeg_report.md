<h2 class="page-break-before">1. Executive Summary</h2>

This Record-Keeping & Evidence Gaps (RKEG) report focuses solely on evidential risk indicators identified from the supplied payroll and HR data. The review assesses how complete, consistent and traceable payroll-related records appear for audit and dispute purposes. It does **not** determine whether payroll outcomes are correct or incorrect under applicable legislation, awards or agreements.

Across the dataset provided, the automated checks identified:

- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0
- **Low:** 0

A detailed breakdown by severity is provided in the **Findings Overview** section.

<h2 class="page-break-before">2. Data Sources</h2>

This review was generated from the following analysis outputs within the project `outputs/` directory:

- `rkeg_summary_by_severity.csv`  
- `rkeg_findings.csv`  
- `executive\executive_summary.md`  
- `executive\executive_summary.json`  

These outputs were produced by rule-based checks over payroll and HR CSV extracts supplied by the organisation for the review period.

### **Record-Keeping & Evidence Gaps (RKEG) – Scope & Methodology**

**Scope**

The Record-Keeping & Evidence Gaps (RKEG) review assesses whether payroll-related records are sufficiently complete, consistent and traceable to support the organisation’s ability to evidence payroll decisions if reviewed by auditors or regulators.

RKEG focuses on evidential strength, not on determining whether payroll outcomes are correct or incorrect. Findings highlight where records may be incomplete, inconsistent, or difficult to substantiate if challenged.

This review is intended to support risk-aware payroll operations by identifying evidence weaknesses that can increase audit effort, increase dispute risk, or reduce the organisation’s ability to confidently explain pay decisions.

**Data reviewed**

- employee master data (where supplied)
- pay event / payroll transaction extracts (where supplied)
- termination and employment status fields where included in the engagement data pack

**Checks performed**

- completeness checks for key employee master fields required for traceability and defensibility
- identification of orphan or untraceable pay events (for example, pay events with missing or inconsistent identifiers)
- consistency checks across employee status and payroll activity where possible
- identification of gaps that may require manual reconstruction to support an audit trail

**Out of scope**

This review does not:

- calculate entitlements, underpayments or overpayments
- interpret awards, enterprise agreements, or employment contracts
- provide legal, accounting, or industrial relations advice
- assert contraventions of legislation or confirm non-compliance.

RKEG findings should be interpreted as evidential risk indicators. Addressing them improves defensibility and reduces audit effort, but does not necessarily imply a payroll outcome is incorrect.

<h2>4. Findings Overview</h2>

<div class="no-findings">
No material record-keeping and evidence gaps findings were identified in the current dataset.

<h2>5. Detailed Findings</h2>

<div class="no-findings">
No record-keeping or evidence gaps were identified for the supplied data.
</div>

<h2>6. Limitations & Assumptions</h2>

This review is subject to the following limitations:

- Calculations assume the underlying pay rates, loadings and multipliers are correct in the source systems.
- Award and enterprise agreement interpretation is not performed by this tool.
- Holiday calendars, leave rules and accrual settings are assumed to reflect the organisation’s intended configuration.
- Data quality issues (missing records, duplicates, inconsistent identifiers) may affect the completeness and accuracy of the results.

---

<h2>7. Recommended Next Steps</h2>

1. Validate the highest-severity findings first.
2. Review the most affected modules and confirm whether findings reflect genuine control issues or data limitations.
3. Address structural data gaps that weaken evidentiary confidence.
4. Confirm root causes before remediation.
5. Re-run the review after corrective action to confirm that risk indicators have reduced.
